   <p> God, the Lord, and Giver of life, who was active in the Old Testament, and given to the Church in fullness at Pentecost. He empowers believers for service and witnessing. He cleanses man from the old nature conforming us to the image of Christ. The In-Filling of the Holy Spirit, following conversion, releases the fullness of the Spirit and is evidenced by the fruits and the gifts of the Holy Spirit that include a Super Natural Prayer Language for each and every Believer. This Super Natural Prayer Language is an intimate and unique communication between you and God.</p>
