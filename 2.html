    <p>Jesus Christ is eternally God. He was together with the Father and the Holy Spirit from the beginning of creation, and through Him, all things were made. He left heaven and became man by the Holy Spirit through the virgin Mary for manâ€™s redemption (the act of paying our sin debt in full). Therefore, He is forever one Christ with two natures, God and Man, in one person.</p>
